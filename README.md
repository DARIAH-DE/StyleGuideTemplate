The goal of this template is to facilitate the development of interfaces for web tools that are part of the DARIAH-DE ecosystem.

This template is based on the report [R. 1.2.2/R. 7.5 *Usability Criteria for External Requests of Collaboration*](https://wiki.de.dariah.eu/download/attachments/14651583/R1.2.2-7.5_final.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1452850842838&api=v2), specifically the *DARIAH-DE Style Guide* contained in the Appendix.

This style guide was compiled by [Malte Vogl](https://github.com/maltevogl), Hanna Meiners and Klaus Thoden, based on a design by [Tobias Sch√§fer](https://github.com/tschaef).

This work is based on the previous template, which was packaged together by [Matteo Romanello](https://github.com/mromanello) and was based on the layout design by [Patrick Heck](https://github.com/patrickheck).

## Global Menu

WORK IN PROGRESS

To ensure the global navigation menu remains consistent accross all services, make sure to use a minimal `ul` with `id="home_dropdown_menu"` as in the template and to include
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/globalmenu.js"></script>
```
which will load the central version.
